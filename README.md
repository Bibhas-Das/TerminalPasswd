# 🔐 TerminalPasswd (Login to Terminal Window)

A secure and intelligent terminal login system with password protection and automatic login capabilities using USB, Bluetooth, or Wi-Fi device detection.

## 🚀 Features

* 🔒 **Secure Password Protection**: Enforces terminal login only after password validation.
* 🔌 **Auto-login via USB Device**: Automatically logs in when a specific USB device is connected.
* 📶 **Auto-login via Bluetooth**: Logs in when a trusted Bluetooth device is nearby.
* 🌐 **Auto-login via Wi-Fi**: Enables login when connected to a trusted Wi-Fi network.
* 📄 **Log Management**: All login activities are logged for auditing.
* 🧪 **Compatibility**: Works on Linux systems with basic shell and `systemd` capabilities.

## 🛠️ Requirements

* Linux-based OS (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian, Arch)
* `bash` shell/ `zsh` shell/
* `bluetoothctl`, `rfkill`, and `hciconfig` (for Bluetooth)
* `nmcli` (for Wi-Fi)
* `udevadm` (for USB detection)
* `systemd` (to set up the login service)
* `git` (to clone the repository)
* And make sure those listed commands are installed in your system: `md5sum, grep, cat, echo, tr, ffmpeg, ip, awk, read, cut, ps, iwlist, sleep, clear, trap, wc, chmod, ls, upower, pgrep, date, free, curl, mkdir git`

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone this repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:Bibhas-Das/TerminalPasswd.git
   cd TerminalPasswd
   ```

2. **Configure Settings**:

   * Edit `config.sh` to set your trusted devices (USB ID, Bluetooth MAC, or Wi-Fi SSID).
   * Set your secure login password in the configuration.

3. **Install Service (Optional)**:

   * To run this on boot, create a `systemd` service:

     ```bash
     sudo cp login-terminal.service /etc/systemd/system/
     sudo systemctl daemon-reexec
     sudo systemctl enable login-terminal.service
     sudo systemctl start login-terminal.service
     ```

## ⚙️ Usage

Run the program manually:

```bash
./login-terminal.sh
```

Or allow it to run on boot via systemd.

## 📁 Directory Structure

```
login-to-terminal/
├── login-terminal.sh         # Main script
├── config.sh                 # Configuration for trusted devices and password
├── login-terminal.service    # Optional systemd unit
├── logs/                     # Login logs
└── README.md                 # Project documentation
```

## 🧩 Customization

You can modify `login-terminal.sh` to:

* Add new authentication modes (e.g., NFC, voiceprint)
* Change logging behavior
* Customize prompts and visuals

## 🛡️ Security Notice

While convenient, auto-login methods (USB, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi) reduce security and should be used with caution in sensitive environments. Always have a fallback password login enabled.
